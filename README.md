# Food Mood - CS348Proj

## Starting local server
Ensure you have a credentials file for your GCP MySQL server.
```creds.json```

Download the cloud_sql_proxy binary.
```wget https://dl.google.com/cloudsql/cloud_sql_proxy.linux.amd64 -O cloud_sql_proxy```

Start your proxy in a terminal.
```./cloud_sql_proxy  -instances=cs348s2020:us-central1:cs348-1=tcp:3306 -credential_file=creds.json```

In a new terminal, start your server.
```python test.py```

## Sample Database
To create sample tables, run the commands in ```sql_scripts/createTables.sql```.

To populate tables with sample data, run the commands in ```sql_scripts/populateTables.sql```.

To drop sample tables, run the commands in ```sql_scripts/dropTables.sql```.

## Generating the Production Database
Make sure you have run the above to create the sample tables and populate the tables with sample data.

To get the raw data, download the CSV file at the link [https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions?select=RAW_recipes.csv]
You will also need the following CSV file used for random recipe.authorName generation [https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/us-baby-names?select=StateNames.csv]

You can then run the ```extract_data.py``` script to extract and generate the production database. Ensure the script is located in the same directory as the above CSV files. Modify lines 215 to 220 to ensure you have the proper parameters for a connection to your SQL database, and ensure you have a local connection to the server before running the script.
```python
drivername="mysql+pymysql",
username='root',
password='',
host='127.0.0.1',
port='3306',
database='db_1',
```
For the sake of simplicity, the use of a custom google search module for finding image links online for the recipe.imageUrl attribute has been left out if you do wish to run the script. To see the code used to generate image URLs please see the ```extract_data.ipynb``` script.
